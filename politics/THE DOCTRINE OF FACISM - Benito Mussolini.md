description: Benito Mussolini was an Italian politician, teacher, and journalist who wrote for left-wing newspapers. He enlisted in the army, rising to the rank of sergeant. In 1922, he organized the "March on Rome," and with the support of King Victor Emmanuel III, he took over the cabinet as the Prime Minister of Italy. In 1925, Mussolini became " Il Duce" (the supreme leader of Italy). Mussolini founded the National Fascist Party and became the most representative politician of fascist ideology. In " The Doctrine of Fascism," Mussolini synthesizes fascist doctrine and its principles while also pointing out what he considers the limitations of other ideologies such as liberalism and socialism.
