# set properties
## set closure
a set is closed under an operation if when applying this operation to any two of it's member you end up with a member of the set
## identity
the identity of a set under an operation is an element for which if you apply the operation to another element and the identity you end up with the other element
## inverses
two inverse element are element that when you apply the operation to them you get the identity
## associative property
$(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$
$(ab)c=a(bc)$

# group
## definition
- set of element G
- operation: *
- closed under operation $$x,y \in G \implies x*y \in G$$
- inverses: $x^{-1}$ exist for all $x$ $$x*x^{-1}=e$$
- identity: $$y*e=e*y=y$$
- associativity: $$(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$$
### commutative
abelian group
### non commutative
nonabelian group
## subgroup
$$H \leq G$$
H is a subgroup of G
$$H < G$$
H is a proper subgroup of G
### definition
a subgroup of G is a subset of G and is also a group
is group as at least two subgroup
- G
- $\{e\}$
### Lagrange's theorem
$$H \le G \implies |H|\ divides\ |G|$$
## cyclic group
G is cyclic if it's generated by a single element$$G = <x>$$every cyclic group is either the integers or the integers mod n
### fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups
any abelian group which is finitely generated can be broken in finite number of cyclic group

## homomorphisms
$$G\ *\ H\ +$$
$$x,y\in G$$
$$x*y=z$$
$$f:G\to H$$
$$x \mapsto f(x)$$
$$y \mapsto f(y)$$
$$z \mapsto f(z)$$
$$x*y=z \implies f(x)+f(y)=f(x*y)$$


## order of a group
number of element of a group
$|G|$
