a set is a "collection" of things
these things are called elements
two sets are equal if they contain the same elements
if a set $X$ is finite, its cardinality $|X|$ is the amount of element in it
## ZFC axioms
### axiom of extensionality
$$\forall x\forall y[\forall z(z\in x\iff z\in y)\implies x=y]$$
### axiom of regularity
$$\forall x[x\ne\varnothing\implies\exists y(y\in x\land y\cap x=\varnothing)]$$
###

## cardinality
two sets have the same cardinality $\iff$ there is a [bijection](algebra.md#bijection) between them
$|A|=|B|$ is the same as $A\sim B$
$[a,b]\sim [ca,cb]$
$(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})\sim \Re$
if $S\sim\mathbb{N}$ then $S$ is countably infinite
if $S$ is infinite but $S\nsim\mathbb{N}$ then $S$ is uncountable
$|s|<|P(S)|$
the number of transfinite cardinalities is larger than the cardinality of any set
